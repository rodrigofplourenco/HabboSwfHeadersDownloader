# This is to get packet headers from any production (I did it for plus emulator c#)
## To change PRODUCTION go to main.ts and change constant PRODUCTION at line 5
<p>Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies</p>
<p>Run 'npm run generate' to get your packet headers</p>
<p>By default you ll have your headers at generated/PRODUCTION/</p>
